# UFO
## Overview
The purpose of this project was to create a webpage with a dynamic table with the ability to filter the UFO sighting data through multiple criteria at the same time. 
## Results 
The finished page allows the user to filter the data by date, city, state, country and shape of the flying object. The unfiltered data is all included in the main body of the web page which is extremely cumbersome to scroll through to identify the users desired results. Once the user filters any of the criteria, the data is filtered, and the results are narrowed to view. The user can tab through the filters or press enter for results once any valid input is placed in the filters. 
## Summary 
The webpage is straightforward, and layout is clean but bland. The dataset provided to filter is very small so the user will not be able to find much information unless the filter is set for the dates of 1/1/2010 - 1/13/2010. One of the recommendations I have is to replace the previous filter button with a "clear filter" button to remove all user input and start a clean search. Due to the entire dataset being included on one page I would add additional pages to allow the user to click through pages of data rather than scroll. I would also apply an option for the data set to be downloaded by the user in a csv format if wanted. For cosmetic purposes a few more images on the website to make it more visually appealing as well.
